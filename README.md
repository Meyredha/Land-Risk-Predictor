# Land-Risk-Predictor
The project aims that an application uses machine learning to predict landslide risk based on environmental factors. Our Random Forest model analyzes multiple environmental parameters to assess landslide probability.The Key Features were used for 
🔮 AI-Powered Predictions: Upload your data and get instant landslide risk assessments
📊 Interactive Visualizations: Beautiful charts, graphs, and correlation analysis
🗺️ Geospatial Mapping: View risk zones on interactive maps
📈 Model Insights: Explore feature importance and model performance
📱 User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface
